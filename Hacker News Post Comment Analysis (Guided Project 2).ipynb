    "Our goal is to look at posts that specifically are `Ask HN` and `Show HN`.  `Ask HN` are posts where the user are asking everyone on the forum a question.  `Show HN` are posts that the user is showing the forum something they have done.  We will be comparing how many comments each of these types of posts get.  We will also be looking to see if posts made at a certain time get more comments."

    "Now we have a nice list of average comments per hour.  We sorted the list by the average number of comments so that it is easier to see the best times to post.  One thing to keep in mind about the data set is that the times in the data set are Eastern Time.  This means that the top time of 3:00PM for the data set is actually 2:00PM for us.  That leaves the best times for us to post as 2:00PM, 12:00PM, 11:00AM, 9:00AM, and 4:00PM.  Four of these top 5 times are within 3 hours of noon.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we took a data set from the forum website Hacker News which is popular in technology and startup circles.  Our goal was to compare Show HN posts which are posts that show off something someone has done and Ask HN posts which are posts that ask the HN community a question.  The way we are comparing the posts are by the average number of comments each post gets.  Our next goal is the see what hour is best to post and get the most number of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between Ask HN posts and Show HN posts showed us that on average Ask HN posts get on average 4 comments more than Show HN posts.  One possible reason is because multiple people can answer a question and add to a previous answer while commenting on someone's achievement tends to be all similar comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best hour to post.  For this goal we focused on Ask HN posts to see which hour had the most average comments per post.  One thing to note about the data set is that the times are in Eastern Time.  In Texas, we are using Central Time so that would be 1 hour behind the times in the data set.  Based on the data, for us 2:00PM is the best time to post. With 11:00AM and 12:00PM being the next best.  This leaves a 4 hour window in the afternoon for us to post and on average get a good number of comments."
